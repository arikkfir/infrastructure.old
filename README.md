# infrastructure

This repository manages Cloud infrastructure underlying my domains, pet projects & research.

Since it is focused on the actual Cloud Provider (GCP) infrastructure, Terraform is the tool of choice, and this repository is composed mostly of Terraform files, applying the following main resources:

- GCP project settings
- Necessary IAM permissions
- Google Networking
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## Roadmap

- GitHub Global settings
- GitHub repositories
